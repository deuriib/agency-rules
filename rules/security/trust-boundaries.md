# Trust Boundaries

Every endpoint, adapter, webhook handler, and payload parser is a door, and a
door gets a screen before it gets traffic. The prohibitions themselves are in
`deny-hard-gates`; this is the review that happens before they apply.

## The screen

Run the OWASP Top 10 against the new boundary as a checklist and record an
answer for each row. "Not applicable" is an answer. Silence is not.

| Risk | Ask |
| --- | --- |
| Broken access control | Who may call this, and is that checked server-side per object? |
| Cryptographic failure | Does anything sensitive travel or rest without encryption? |
| Injection | Can input reach a query, command, path, template, or log unparameterized? |
| Insecure design | Is there a rate limit, an abuse case, and a defined failure mode? |
| Security misconfiguration | Debug off, no default credentials, headers set, errors not verbose? |
| Vulnerable components | Are the dependencies current and scanned? |
| Authentication failures | Session fixation, credential stuffing, a weak reset flow? |
| Data integrity failures | Are updates and deserialization authenticated? |
| Logging failures | Are security events logged without PII, and are the alerts owned? |
| SSRF | Can input choose a URL, host, or port? |

## Rules

- **Classify the caller before writing the handler.** Anonymous, authenticated,
  service, or admin — the answer decides the authorization model, and it is
  cheaper to decide it now than to retrofit it.
- **One parser per boundary, and it validates.** A schema at the edge produces a
  typed value; nothing downstream re-parses raw input.
- **Deny by default.** A new route with no explicit authorization decision is not
  reachable.
- **Cap the input before parsing.** Max body size, array length, string length,
  nesting depth, and a parse timeout. An unbounded parser is a denial of service
  with a valid content type.
- **Reject unknown fields** in a request model rather than silently ignoring
  them — an ignored field is a field someone will later trust.
- **Never echo input back unencoded** — not in an error, not in a redirect, not
  in a log field.
- **Log the decision, not the payload.** Record the caller, the route, and the
  outcome. Never the body.
- **A new boundary is a new threat model.** State what an attacker can send and
  what it reaches, in the PR.
