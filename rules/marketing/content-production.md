# Content Production

An asset ships with three things the reader never sees: the brand it follows, the
licence behind it, and the accessibility it provides.

## Brand

- **Brand guidelines are enforced** — voice, tone, logo usage, colour, typography.
  An off-brand asset is not a creative choice; it dilutes the one asset that
  compounds.
- **Use the approved logo file** at its clear space and minimum size, never a
  screenshot or a re-export.
- **Tone is set by the channel and the audience**, not by the writer's mood. Same
  brand, different register.

## Accessibility

Accessibility is not a compliance line; it decides whether the message reaches
the people it was written for.

- **Every image carries alt text that conveys its message**, or an empty alt when
  it is purely decorative.
- **Every video has captions, every audio a transcript.** Auto-captions are a
  starting point, corrected by a human.
- **Contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA** — 4.5:1 for body text. A beautiful colour pair
  nobody can read is a failed asset.
- **Body copy is set at a readable size**, and colour is never the only signal
  carrying meaning.
- **Text baked into an image is a last resort** — it cannot be resized,
  translated, or read aloud well.

## Licensing

- **Every image, font, track, and footage clip has a licence on file before it
  ships**, recording the scope it permits: channel, territory, duration, and
  whether it covers paid media.
- **An organic licence is not a paid licence**, and a licence for one territory is
  not a licence for another.
- **No "found it on the internet".** There is no free asset whose origin nobody
  recorded.
- **Stock libraries and generated assets carry their own terms.** Read the
  commercial-use clause, not the download page.
- **Credit where the licence requires it**, in the form it requires.
- Dependency licences are a different concern — those are in `supply-chain`.

## Before it ships

- **Model-generated assets get a human checkpoint here** before they ship. The
  prohibition and the obligations are in `deny-hard-gates`; this is where the
  checkpoint happens.
- **Localization is not translation.** Idioms, currency, date format, imagery, and
  humour change per market.
