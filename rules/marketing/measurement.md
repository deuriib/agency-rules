# Measurement

A metric is a claim about the business, so it gets the same substantiation as any
other claim — see `claims-and-evidence`.

## Definitions

- **One definition per metric, written down, used everywhere.** CAC, LTV, ROAS,
  and conversion mean one thing here, with the formula and the window stated.
- **State the window.** ROAS over a day and ROAS over a year are different
  businesses.
- **No vanity metric presented as a business result.** Impressions, reach, and
  followers are inputs; revenue, margin, and retention are outcomes.
- **A metric that cannot change a decision is not reported.** A dashboard nobody
  acts on is a cost, not a control.

## Attribution

- **The attribution methodology is documented** — model, window, and its known
  gaps.
- **No double counting across channels**, and no crediting organic conversions to
  the last paid click without saying so.
- **No hidden spend.** Every cost that produced the number is inside it: agency
  fees, tooling, and creative production.
- **Platform numbers and analytics numbers will disagree.** Say which one you are
  quoting.

## Budget

- **Budget is tracked per channel and reconciled against the invoice**, not
  against the plan.
- **No overspend without approval**, and no silent reallocation that makes one
  channel look efficient at another's expense.

## Experiments

- **Pre-register the hypothesis before the test starts**: the change, the metric,
  the expected effect, and the stopping rule. A hypothesis written after the
  result is a story.
- **Size the test before running it.** A sample too small to detect the effect
  produces a confident wrong answer.
- **Validity is required, not optional** — no peeking and stopping on the first
  good day, no fishing across comparisons, no reporting whichever subgroup
  happened to win.
- **No dark patterns in the variant, and no test that harms a cohort.** Running an
  experiment is not a licence to mistreat a segment.
- **A null result is a result.** Report it; it is the only thing that stops the
  same test being rerun next quarter.
