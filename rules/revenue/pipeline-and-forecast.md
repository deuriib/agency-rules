# Pipeline and Forecast

A forecast is a promise to the board made out of other people's optimism. The CRM
is what makes it checkable.

## One source of truth

- **The CRM is the only pipeline.** A deal that is not in it does not exist for a
  forecast — the spreadsheet, the whiteboard, and the rep's head are not pipeline.
  The prohibition on shadow pipelines is in `deny-hard-gates`.
- **Every deal carries an owner, a stage, an amount, a close date, a next step,
  and the evidence of buyer intent.** A deal missing any of them is a name, not an
  opportunity.
- **Stage definitions are documented and enforced** — what must be true to enter
  each stage, written in one place, applied to everyone.

## Stage honesty

- **No stage advances without its exit criteria met.** A stage is an evidence
  claim, not a mood.
- **No sandbagging and no happy ears.** Both are forecast lies with opposite signs,
  costing the business a surprise miss or a wasted quarter.
- **A deal with no next step and a close date in the past is dead.** Mark it lost
  with a reason code and move on.
- **No side agreement moves an amount or a term** — the written-record rule is in
  `deny-hard-gates`.

## Forecast

- **Submitted on schedule, with a confidence level and the assumptions behind it.**
  "We'll hit it" is not a forecast.
- **The weighted pipeline methodology is documented and applied consistently** —
  same stages, same probabilities, every quarter.
- **No manual reweighting to reach a target.** If the methodology produces a miss,
  the miss is the output.

## Closed deals

- **Every closed-won and closed-lost deal carries a reason code.** Without it the
  outcome is unlearnable and the pattern is invisible.
- **Material deals get a post-mortem**: what we believed, what happened, what
  changes because of it.
- **No vanity metric in a revenue review** — the definition discipline is in
  `measurement`.
