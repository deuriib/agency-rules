# Post-Sale

The deal is signed; the risk is not retired. Most churn is decided during
onboarding and reported a year later.

## Onboarding

- **Every milestone has an owner and an SLA.** "Implementation in progress" with no
  date is a customer who is not sure anyone is working on it.
- **No silent churn.** A customer who stops responding is a risk to escalate, not a
  row to leave sitting at "onboarding".
- **Time-to-first-value is measured**, because it is the leading indicator of
  renewal — more than any health score.

## Health

- **Health scores are defined, monitored, and acted on.** A score nobody acts on is
  a dashboard, not a signal.
- **A documented escalation exists for at-risk accounts**, naming who is told and by
  when.
- **Usage is a signal, not the score.** A login count says nothing about whether the
  customer got value; a support ticket can be the best evidence of engagement.

## Renewals and expansion

- **Renewals and expansions are forecast separately from new business.** Mixing
  them hides a shrinking base behind growing new sales.
- **Auto-renewals are reviewed 90 days before expiry** — the commercial
  conversation, at the point where the customer can still be saved rather than the
  week after the contract lapsed. The legal and contract review at 60 days is
  `contracts`, and the two windows exist because they answer different questions:
  whether to renew, and on what terms.
- **The renewal conversation starts with usage evidence**, not with a renewal
  quote.

## Churn

- **Churn reasons are coded, analyzed, and fed back to product and marketing.** A
  coded reason nobody reads is a folder.
- **No hidden churn by reclassification.** Moving a lost account to "inactive", or
  recording a downsize as a new logo, is the one revenue manipulation that survives
  audit — and it corrupts the forecast the whole company depends on.
- **Every churn reason maps to an action someone owns.** Otherwise the same loss
  repeats next quarter with a new code.
