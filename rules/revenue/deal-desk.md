# Deal Desk

Every discount is a pricing decision made under time pressure by someone who is
not the pricing owner. The only defence is a documented threshold and a logged
exception.

## Discounts and terms

- **Discounts, non-standard terms, and deviations require approval per the
  threshold matrix.** The matrix is written, current, and identical for every rep.
- **The floor is enforced in the quoting tool, not in a policy document.** A
  control that depends on the rep remembering is not a control.
- **Overrides are logged, time-bound, and reviewed monthly.** An override that
  keeps repeating is a pricing decision nobody made deliberately.
- **No ad-hoc pricing per rep.** A pricing change goes through the pricing owner —
  CRO, Finance, and Product together — not through the deal in front of you.

## Contracts

- **Terms, SLAs, and pricing are reviewed by legal and finance before signature.**
  Not after, and not "we will paper it later".
- **No signature by an unauthorized role.** Signing authority is a list, and being
  trusted is not the same as being on it.
- **A verbal commitment or a side letter does not bind the company**, and must
  never be implied to close a deal. The absolute rule is in `deny-hard-gates`.
- **A deviation from the standard contract is an exception with an owner and an
  expiry**, not an edit to the template.

## What an approval is not

- **An approval is not a favour to a specific rep.** If the same exception keeps
  being approved, the matrix is wrong and should change once, for everyone.
- **An approval has a name attached.** "Approved internally" is not an approval,
  because nobody can be asked about it later.
- **Urgency is not a reason.** A deal that only closes without approval is a deal
  that was not priced to close.
